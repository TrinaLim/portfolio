## Introduction to my portfolio 

This portfolio is a personal project that includes all the workshops, CCAs, Volunteers etc that I have attended. 

Home.js is a small introduction to me and the remaining pages are as stated. 

On the top right hand of the navbar contains my github link containing all my projects that I did with their respective codes, and my LinkedIn link. 

I coded this using react.js library, which was self-taught.
